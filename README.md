# JavaScript Scraping Tutorial

## Introduction

For scraping web pages that use JavaScript, we can use Selenium, a browser automation library. Selenium allows us to control a web browser through code, enabling us to navigate pages, interact with elements, and extract dynamic information generated by JavaScript.

In this tutorial, we will create a Python script that uses Selenium to extract links from a web page. Additionally, we will use Docker to run our script in an isolated environment.

## Usage

### Start Services and Run the Scraping Script

1. **Build the Docker image and start the services**:
    ```sh
    make run-js
    ```

2. **Run the scraping script withoud javascript**:
    ```sh
    make run
    ```

This will start the Nginx web server and the scraping script inside a Docker container, extracting the links from the specified web page.

## Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates how to use Selenium and Docker for scraping a web page that uses JavaScript. Selenium enables us to effectively interact with dynamic web pages, while Docker ensures that our environment is isolated and reproducible.
